# Python exercises

These are python exercises performed for general personal enrichment and to become more proficient in Python.
Python was harder to pick up than Ruby, but there are so many modules and extensions to Python to make things
easier that it is worth switching. The sheer weight of its userbase helps ... in that way its a lot like the 
Raspberry Pi and its competitors -- the competition might be faster, have better hardware, more memory and so on,
but the Raspberry Pi's userbase makes working with the system much easier because of the documentation and available help.

This Repo is also used to learn GIT discipline better as well and integration with Microsoft Visual Code.  A common problem
that develops with VC controlled deployments is running into bare repos.  This was fixed with the following command on the Repo:

--> git config --unset core.bare
